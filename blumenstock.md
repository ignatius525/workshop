The promises brought about by big data are increasingly beneficial: humanitarian aid and finacial lending can be more easily dispersed by analyzing cell phone usage or satelliate images. More efficient algorithms are created every year, and can be incresingly accurate at analyzing satelliate imaging, allowing for quicker human development in impoverished regions of the world. However, with the rich having access to such data, it is quite common that the richer get richer, while the poorer get taken advantage off and continue to sink deeper into poverty. Such concept is common with "payday" loans, as the poor are unaware of high interest rates on short-term loans, falling into debt traps. Additionally, algorithms created to help those in need have not been proven accurate for future issues. Once the people find out that their personal decisions are used to make long-term decisions for the region, people might try to decieve the algorithm to gain some benefits. Bias is also everpresent, as the most disadvantaged people are usually the least-represented in the use of big data. Some of the prerequisites to be included in such data sets are not met by the poorest in the world, such as the use of a cell phone.
